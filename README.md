# Charter-Predictor
Python Analysis contains the Jupyter notebooks used to gather the data and perform the analysis to create Charter Predictor. 


The folders contain all the original data required to run the analysis. However, a personal API key was required to query GreatSchools data, 
and thus the constructed data set must be used to to re-create the analysis. 


The Flask_App folder contains all the folders for running CharterPredictor. A Google Maps API key used to create a map depicting 
schools' locations is not included. Please send any questions to pjcizek@gmail.com.
